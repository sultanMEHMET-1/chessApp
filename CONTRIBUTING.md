# Contributing

Thanks for contributing to this repository. This project is developed via Agent Orchestrator, so follow the workflow below closely.

## Workflow (Short)
1. Read `AGENTS.md` before making any code changes.
2. Create a feature branch per issue, named to link the issue (for example `feat/1`).
3. Keep commits small and focused. Each commit message must be 2 to 3 sentences across multiple lines and include the issue reference.
4. Run unit tests (Vitest) and the Playwright smoke suite before pushing.
5. Open one PR per issue and link the issue in the PR description.

## Tooling
- Node.js 20+
- pnpm
- React + TypeScript + Vite
- Vitest and Playwright
